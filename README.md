A project written to easily retrieve Twitter data, namely trending topics and hashtags without the use of the Twitter API

## Details 
Twitter does provide an API in order to access statistics, data and tweets. However this requires a validated developer account. This project gets around that limitation by retrieving and sorting data from third party scrapers and provides easy methods (as outlined in main.py) to retrieve that information / integrate it into another Python project. 
	
## Details 
This package assumes a Python3 environment, with requirements listed in the "requirements.txt" file for PIP3, you can run the following to get the dependancies. 

```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```
